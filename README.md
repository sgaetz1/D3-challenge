# D3-challenge
This is the repository for my D3 homework. This assignment uses data from the US Census Bureau and includes one year of estimates for rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. This assignment uses the ```D3.js``` library to create a scatterplot with multiple variables on each axis allowing users to decide which data to display. To check it out, do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
1. Open VS Code and navigate to the root directory  of the repo.
1. Right click on ```index.html``` and click on *Open with live server.*
