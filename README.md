# D3-challenge
This is the repository for my D3 homework. This assignment uses data from the US Census Bureau and includes one year of estimates for rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. This assignment uses the d3 library to place multiple variable on each axis allowing users to decide which data to display.
